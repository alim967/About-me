I am Associate at Revature and attending the training to learn distinct new technologies every day to become full stack java developer. 
I graduated with Cum Laude honors from the City University of New York(CUNY) with a bachelor of science degree in computer information systems in May 2020. 
After graduating from Lehman I was preparing myself for the various government jobs.

While I was searching for the job without any practical skills in IT fields, fortunately I explore the rewarding opportunities that Revature offering. 
I joined Revature to step into the IT industry.

During my training at Revature, I am learning multiple new technologies every week and I’ve been working on projects where 
I gained experience in full stack web application building and implementation and skilled on Talend for data integration. 

    *Build application using business rules and policies, UI actions between client, server, and database.
    *Worked on projects using frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
    *Learned and demonstrated skills in data management.
    *Strong ability for solving problems, and able to work collaboratively within a team or independently.
    *Self-motivated and excited to learn new technologies and explore new solutions.
    *Strong oral and written communication skills.
